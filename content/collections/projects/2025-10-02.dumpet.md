Dumpet.fun is a decentralized platform that turns everyday debates into competitive duels with real stakes. Born from the observation that people love arguing online but rarely back up their opinions, the platform gamifies trivial debates by letting users vote on their preferred side in matchups ranging from "Milk vs Orange Juice" to "Taylor Swift Super Bowl Attendance" while earning platform currency for being on the winning side. Built on the AO Protocol with ArDrive for permanent decentralized storage, React and Vite for the frontend, and ShadcnUI components for polished interfaces, Dumpet.fun combines social engagement with betting mechanics. Users can create duels, stake currency on their stance, track real-time voting stats, and participate in debate discussions, with winners determined by popular vote. The platform successfully tackles complex challenges including real-time data synchronization, secure deposit/withdrawal systems, vote manipulation prevention, and liquidity management across multiple duelsâ€”all while maintaining an intuitive user experience that makes competitive debating accessible and fun for casual users.
