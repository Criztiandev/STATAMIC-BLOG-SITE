Statamic is a PHP-based, Laravel-powered content management system (CMS) known for its flat-file architecture, which means it stores content in files (like markdown) instead of a database by default. This approach makes websites built with Statamic fast, secure, and easier to manage, especially for developers, and it offers a flexible system that can function as a traditional CMS, a headless CMS with a GraphQL API, or a static site generator.
